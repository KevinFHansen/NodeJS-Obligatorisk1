<h1 id="api">Rest Api</h1>

Rest is a way of defining a global way of designing and API. 
There are some code conventions that we must follow in order for an api to be restfull. 
E.g it uses a specific order of HTTP methods, and is centralized around the structure of the URL.

<h1 id="http">HTTP</h1>

Responsible for communication between web servers and clients 
HTTP determines how requests and reponses should be handlded in web development. 
Http is stateless, which means that every request is independant. So everytime we make a new request, we also get a new response. 
Every time we visit a webpage, submits a form or click a button we send a request towards a webserver. 

In the HTTP protocol we can also set what's call headers. I like to see them as rules for our request/reponse cyclus.
In the request we can set things like: Cookies, Content-Type, Authorization e.g.
In the response we can set things like: Set-cookie and Date e.g.
They also have some common headers such as: Request URL, Request Method and Status Code e.g.

A great tool to test your endpoints without a browser is with the tool <strong>postman.</strong> I've installed the desktop application which allows me to group and reuse endpoints.
