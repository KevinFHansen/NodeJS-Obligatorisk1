<h1>Variables</h1>

Variables is a container for data values in javascript. We have to different ways of declaring a variable.
     The rule of thumb on this subject is that if we want to be able to change the values in the varialble we would use the "let" keyword, and on the contrary we use "const" if aren't
     expecting to reassign the value. However if the "const" is an object or array we are able to change the elements of the array.

<h1 id="typecoercion">Type Coercion</h1>

Type coercion is about forcing one type into another. 
The operators "-, *, /, %" converts ur values into a number. The "+" behaves a bit differently because it's also able to concatenate strings. Javascript converts to a string if it has to choose between that and other data types.

You can also use parseFloat() and parseInt() to convert a string into a number. 
String() converts the given value to a string.

Another important thing to mention is the comparison- and logical opertators. 
We use comparison operators to compare values and logical operators to check for multiple statements. 



<h1 id="callbackfunctions">Callback functions</h1>

Javascript is single-threaded and therefore per default it runs i one long stream. Callback functions allows us to run code asynchronously and inject a function into another function, which trigger upon completion of the original function.

<h1 id="loops">Loops</h1>
It is possible to use for loops and while loops in javascript. If u want to run a code block once, or while an expression is true you can use a while loop. 
For loops are used to ittereate through lists and objects, however thats not the recomended way to target specific object.

In javascript we have some recomended ways to ittereate data.
map(), filter() and forEach()

<h1 id="arrowfunctions">Arrow functions</h2>
Arrow functions is another way of writing a function. The syntax is a bit difference and allows us to write simplified cleaner code. The function keyword and the return statement is implicit a part of the arrow function, so we can remove that from our expression.
Likewise we can remove the name for the function, but instead we need to assign it to a variable.
