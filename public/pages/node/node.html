<h1 id="express">Express</h1>

Express is a framework in node, which allows us to easily set up routers, templates and serverside rendering (SSR). 
Express listens to a specified port and runs a server. 
To install express we add "express"" to our dependencies in package.json and go to our directory in a terminal and run the command "npm install".

<h3>package.json</h3>

In package.json we specify our dependencies, which is compareble to what we know as the .pom file from java.

It's like the main root of our project. We can add different libraries and use them for our project. 

We can also define scripts that must run on our server. 

In our case nodemon makes the server constantly listen for changes in the directory. When it does, it restarts, and saves us alot of time in the long run.
We can specify which files it should listen to in the nodemon.json file.

In production we just want to run "node app.js" which starts our server.

<h1 id="modules">Modules</h1>
In the package.json we also add "type": "module". It changes the syntax from require to the use of "Import/Export".

<h1 id="crossenv">Cross env</h1>
Windows can have some issues setting environment variables in the terminal. 
It's worth mentioning that you can use the scripts in package.json to declare those things 
To set the port e.g. "cross-env PORT=8080 nodemon app.js".

<h1 id="ssr">Server Side Rendering (SSR)</h1>
Websites are loaded based on html, css og js files which are fetched from the server. 
Server side rendering is about rendering the webpage before it is sent to the client. 
If we were to render on the client side (CCR), the server would send all the required files and the client would process them afterwards. 
Client side rendering can be benificial in large interactive applications, so we wont overrun our server.
